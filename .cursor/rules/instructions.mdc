# SatWatch Project Instructions

## Project Overview
SatWatch is a satellite traffic monitoring system. The goal is to track satellites in real-time, calculate their positions, and eventually build a comprehensive monitoring dashboard.

## Current Phase
- **Step 1**: Basic ISS tracking with TLE data from CelesTrak
- Future: Expand to multiple satellites, visualization, alerts

## Key Libraries
- **Skyfield**: Astronomical calculations and satellite position tracking
- **Requests**: HTTP requests for downloading TLE data
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations (dependency of Skyfield)

## Data Sources
- **CelesTrak**: Primary source for TLE (Two-Line Element) data
- TLE format: Standard format for satellite orbital elements

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Explain code clearly for beginners
- Use simple, readable code over clever optimizations
- Include comments and docstrings
- Provide installation instructions
- Show how to run scripts
- Break down complex concepts step-by-step

## Code Philosophy
- Start simple, iterate
- Validate inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Make it easy to understand and modify
