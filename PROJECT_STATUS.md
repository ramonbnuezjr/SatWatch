# SatWatch Project Status & Lessons Learned

This document tracks what's working well, challenges we've faced, and solutions we've implemented.

**Last Updated**: January 2025

## ✅ What's Working Well

### 1. **Dual Script Architecture**
- **`iss_tracker.py`**: Downloads TLE from CelesTrak text format
- **`iss_tracker_json.py`**: Works with JSON format (both API and local files)
- Both scripts successfully calculate ISS position using Skyfield
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. **JSON Support with Fallback**
- Script handles JSON with TLE lines (preferred)
- Falls back to constructing TLE lines from orbital elements if needed
- Supports both single object and array formats
- Flexible file loading (local or API)

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Line-by-line code explanations for beginners
- Clear installation instructions
- Multiple documentation formats (README, explanations, guidelines)
- Cursor AI rules for consistent code generation

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Clear error messages for missing data
- Validation of JSON structure and TLE format
- Helpful troubleshooting messages

### 5. **Data Validation**
- `validate_json.py` script checks JSON structure
- Validates required fields (TLE lines or orbital elements)
- Identifies ISS entry correctly (by NORAD ID or name)

### 6. **Successful Testing** ✅
- Scripts tested and verified working (January 2025)
- Successfully loads JSON from local file
- Correctly parses TLE data
- Accurately calculates ISS position
- Displays formatted output as expected
- All dependencies install correctly

### 7. **Streamlit Dashboard** ✅ **NEW**
- Interactive web dashboard with real-time ISS tracking
- World map visualization using Folium
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Dark theme interface
- Sidebar with position data and TLE status
- Data source selection (local file or API)
- Fixed flickering issues for smooth map updates
- Successfully tested and working

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

### Challenge 1: JSON Format Mismatch

**Problem**: 
- Initial JSON file contained individual orbital elements (MEAN_MOTION, ECCENTRICITY, etc.)
- But Skyfield's `EarthSatellite` class requires TLE lines (TLE_LINE1, TLE_LINE2)
- User expected to use just the 5 orbital elements they mentioned

**Root Cause**:
- Skyfield uses SGP4 propagation which requires TLE format
- TLE lines encode orbital elements in a specific fixed-width format
- Individual elements alone aren't sufficient without proper TLE formatting

**Solution**:
1. Updated script to handle both formats:
   - **Preferred**: Use TLE_LINE1 and TLE_LINE2 if present
   - **Fallback**: Construct TLE lines from orbital elements
2. Added TLE lines to JSON file manually (from CelesTrak)
3. Documented that both formats are needed:
   - TLE lines for Skyfield calculations
   - Individual elements for human readability

**Lesson Learned**: 
- Always check library requirements before assuming data format
- TLE format is the industry standard for a reason - it's optimized for SGP4
- Having both formats in JSON gives best of both worlds

### Challenge 4: Dashboard Map Flickering

**Problem**:
- Streamlit dashboard map was flickering every 0.5 seconds
- Map was being recreated on every script rerun
- Poor user experience with constant visual disruption

**Root Cause**:
- Streamlit reruns the entire script on every refresh
- Map was being recreated with dynamic keys based on position
- No caching or stable key mechanism
- Refresh logic was triggering too frequently

**Solution**:
1. Changed map key to fixed value (`"iss_tracker_map"`) instead of dynamic
2. Improved refresh timing logic with better session state management
3. Added delay before rerun to prevent rapid loops
4. Map now only updates when position actually changes significantly

**Lesson Learned**:
- Use stable keys for Streamlit components that shouldn't be recreated
- Session state management is crucial for auto-refresh features
- Small delays can prevent rapid rerun loops
- Fixed keys prevent unnecessary component recreation

---

### Challenge 2: TLE Line Construction Complexity

**Problem**:
- Attempted to construct TLE lines from orbital elements
- TLE format has strict fixed-width fields (69 characters per line)
- Complex formatting rules (epoch as YYDDD.DDDDDDDD, scientific notation for small numbers)

**Root Cause**:
- TLE format specification is very precise
- Many edge cases in formatting (negative numbers, scientific notation)
- Easy to introduce errors in manual construction

**Solution**:
- Implemented `format_tle_line1()` and `format_tle_line2()` functions
- Followed TLE format specification carefully
- Added validation to ensure proper format
- **However**: Still recommend using TLE lines from CelesTrak when available (more accurate)

**Lesson Learned**:
- Prefer using authoritative sources (CelesTrak) for TLE data
- Construction from elements is possible but error-prone
- Always validate TLE format before using with Skyfield

---

### Challenge 3: Understanding Skyfield Requirements

**Problem**:
- Initial assumption: Can use individual orbital elements directly
- Reality: Skyfield needs TLE lines for `EarthSatellite` class
- Confusion about what data format is needed

**Root Cause**:
- Skyfield documentation assumes TLE format
- Not immediately obvious that TLE lines are required
- Individual elements seem more intuitive for beginners

**Solution**:
- Created `JSON_APPROACH_EXPLANATION.md` explaining requirements
- Updated documentation to clarify TLE line requirement
- Added examples showing both formats
- Made script handle both for flexibility

**Lesson Learned**:
- Read library documentation carefully before designing data structures
- TLE format is the standard for good reasons (accuracy, compatibility)
- Documentation should explain "why" not just "how"

---

### Challenge 4: JSON File Structure Validation

**Problem**:
- User copied JSON that had orbital elements but not TLE lines
- Script would fail with unclear error messages
- No way to validate JSON structure before running

**Solution**:
- Created `validate_json.py` script
- Checks for required fields (TLE lines OR orbital elements)
- Provides clear feedback on what's missing
- Identifies ISS entry correctly

**Lesson Learned**:
- Validation tools are essential for data-driven applications
- Clear error messages save debugging time
- Always validate input data structure

---

### Challenge 5: Dashboard Map Flickering

**Problem**:
- Streamlit dashboard map was flickering every 0.5 seconds
- Map was being recreated on every script rerun
- Poor user experience with constant visual disruption
- Made the dashboard difficult to use

**Root Cause**:
- Streamlit reruns the entire script on every refresh
- Map was being recreated with dynamic keys based on position
- No caching or stable key mechanism
- Refresh logic was triggering too frequently

**Solution**:
1. Changed map key to fixed value (`"iss_tracker_map"`) instead of dynamic
2. Improved refresh timing logic with better session state management
3. Added delay before rerun to prevent rapid loops
4. Map now only updates when position actually changes significantly

**Lesson Learned**:
- Use stable keys for Streamlit components that shouldn't be recreated
- Session state management is crucial for auto-refresh features
- Small delays can prevent rapid rerun loops
- Fixed keys prevent unnecessary component recreation

   - Provide context (e.g., "Check internet connection")

### 3. **Code Organization**
   - Separate functions for different tasks
   - Clear function names and docstrings
   - Type hints for better IDE support

### 4. **Documentation**
   - Explain "why" not just "how"
   - Include examples
   - Document challenges and solutions
   - Keep documentation updated with code

### 5. **Streamlit Dashboard Development**
   - Use stable keys for components that shouldn't be recreated
